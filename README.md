# R6Clicker
An automatic Terrorist Hunt/Training Grounds restart clicker for renown grinding.

I made this because I wanted to make something I'd use myself, It's pretty handy for just grinding for skins and operators and stuff and It usually works pretty well.
It's currently made to funtion properly at 1920x1080 resolution, I don't think it'll work correctly on anything else but I might try make different resolution modes for it.

## How To Use
Make sure matchmaking preferences for training grounds is set to Protect Hostage ONLY, then I recommend setting Fortress or any other large map as the only playable map, this will make sure you _actually_ gain renown from it since if you die too fast, you won't recieve any reward. Basically you just start the clicker and load into training grounds. you should eventually die and fail but still recieve some renown bonus, the clicker automatically clicks the restart button so the process repeats itself.

You will probably only gain around 20-36 renown each time but if you leave it on for an entire day it adds up. I recommend also using a booster if you have one since it'll essentially halve the time it takes to make a good amount.
