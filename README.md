# R6Clicker
An automatic Training Grounds renown grinder for Rainbow Six Siege.

I made this because I wanted to make something useful, It's pretty handy for grinding for skins and operators and stuff and It usually works pretty well.
**This will NOT level up your account**.

Direct download for the latest version can be found [here](https://github.com/phreshbrread/R6Clicker/releases/download/v7.0/R6Clicker.exe)

## How To Use
1. Set Training Grounds matchmaking preferences to PROTECT HOSTAGE ONLY.
2. Also set MM preferences to big maps only, I recommend just leaving it only on Fortress.
_Note: If the map is too small you will die too fast and wont gain any renown._
3. Load into a solo training grounds match on easy mode and start the clicker.
4. You should eventually die and fail but still recieve some renown bonus, the clicker automatically hits the restart button so the process repeats itself.

You'll probably only gain around 18-36 renown each time but if you leave it on for an entire day it adds up. I recommend also using a booster if you have one since obviously double the amount of renown gained in a certain time frame.
**Please note that this program cannot be used in the background while you do other things as it moves the mouse cursor every set interval**

## QnA
### Q: Does this count as cheating?
A: Some would say yes, others would argue otherwise. I personally do not believe this program to count as cheats nor did I create it with the intent of cheating. Having a high amount of renown does not grant the player with an advantage and therefore should not be classified as a cheat.
### Q: Can I get banned for using this?
A: Most likely not, I and some others have been using this for a while now and none of our accounts have been penalized.
### Q: Does monitor resolution and aspect ratio matter?
A: Yes, unfortunately due to the way this program is, it will only work with manually programmed resolutions, currently the working ones are 4K, 1440p, 1080p and 1366x768p, on 16:9 aspect ratio aswell. I would like to eventually find a way to make it more versatile.
### Q: Can I set a custom mouse position if I use a different res or aspect ratio?
A: Yes, there is a box that allows you to put in a custom mouse x and y position, unfortunately though each cycle will take around 30 seconds longer than it usually would due to the inability for it to click buttons on the pre-game screen. For finding mouse positions I use [WinSpy++](http://www.catch22.net/software/winspy#).
