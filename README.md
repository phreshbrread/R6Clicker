# R6Clicker
An automatic Training Grounds renown grinder for Rainbow Six Siege.

I made this because I wanted to make something useful, It's pretty handy for grinding for skins and operators and stuff and It usually works pretty well.
**This program will not level you up as you do not gain any XP** (or at least it shouldn't).

## Supported Resolutions
- 3840 x 2160 (4K)
- 2560 x 1440
- 1920 x 1080
- 1366 x 768
- ### Program also supports custom mouse positions in case your resolution isn't listed.

## How To Use
1. Set Training Grounds matchmaking preferences to PROTECT HOSTAGE ONLY.
2. Also set MM preferences to big maps only, I recommend just leaving it only on Fortress or Theme Park.
_Note: If the map is too small you will die too fast and wont gain any renown._
3. Load into a solo training grounds match on easy mode and start the clicker.
4. You should eventually die and fail but still recieve some renown bonus, the clicker automatically hits the restart button so the process repeats itself.

You'll probably only gain around 18-36 renown each time but if you leave it on for an entire day it adds up. I recommend also using a booster if you have one since it'll double the amount of renown you gain each time.
The program also sends keyboard inputs to the game to prevent you from getting kicked.
