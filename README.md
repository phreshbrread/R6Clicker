# R6Clicker
An automatic Terrorist Hunt/Training Grounds restart clicker for renown grinding.

I made this because I wanted to make something I'd use myself, It's pretty handy for just grinding for skins and operators and stuff and It usually works pretty well.
It's currently made to funtion properly at 1920x1080 resolution, I don't think it'll work correctly on anything else but I might try make different resolution modes for it.

## Supported Resolutions (All in 16:9 Aspect Ratio)
- 3840 x 2160
- 2560 x 1440
- 1920 x 1080
- 1366 x 768

## How To Use
1. Set Training Grounds matchmaking preferences to PROTECT HOSTAGE ONLY.
2. Also set MM preferences to big maps only, I recommend just leaving it only on Fortress.
_Note: If the map is too small you will die too fast and wont gain renown._
3. Load into a solo training grounds match and start the clicker, it will then start working.
4. You should eventually die and fail but still recieve some renown bonus, the clicker automatically clicks the restart button so the process repeats itself.

You will probably only gain around 20-36 renown each time but if you leave it on for an entire day it adds up. I recommend also using a booster if you have one since it'll double the amount of renown you gain each time.
