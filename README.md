# R6Clicker
An automatic Training Grounds renown grinder for Rainbow Six Siege.

I made this because I wanted to make something useful, It's pretty handy for grinding for skins and operators and stuff and It usually works pretty well.
**This will not level up your account**.

Direct download for the latest version can be found [here](https://github.com/phreshbrread/R6Clicker/releases/download/v7.1/R6Clicker.exe)

## How To Use
1. Set Training Grounds matchmaking preferences to PROTECT HOSTAGE ONLY.
2. Also set MM preferences to big maps only, I recommend just leaving it only on Fortress.
_Note: If the map is too small you will die too fast and wont gain any renown._
3. Load into a solo training grounds match on easy mode and start the clicker.
4. You should eventually die and fail but still recieve some renown bonus, the clicker automatically hits the restart button so the process repeats itself.

You'll gain around 18-36 renown each round, if you leave it on for an entire day it adds up. I recommend also using a booster if you have one since obviously double the amount of renown gained in a certain time frame.
**This program cannot be used in the background while you do other things as takes direct control of the mouse cursor**
